## 2. Core Features Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) COMPLETE
- Set up Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind/DaisyUI
- Implement basic routing and layout structure
- Create service layer architecture
- Set up Zod validation schemas
- Implement authentication system

### Phase 2: AI Services Integration (Week 2-3) MOSTLY COMPLETE
- OpenAI API integration for:
	- Text generation
	- Image generation
	- Voice synthesis
- Trend analysis service
- Asset enhancement pipeline
- Style transfer system

### Phase 3: Editor Development (Week 3-4) MOSTLY COMPLETE
- Block-based editor core
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Property panels
- Timeline interface
- Real-time collaboration foundation
- Template system architecture
- Transitions/Effects (see example.txt)

### Phase 4: Rendering Pipeline (Week 4-5) MOSTLY COMPLETE
- FFmpeg/WASM integration
- Multi-format export system
- Quality optimization
- Parallel rendering
- Progress tracking

### Phase 5: Template Marketplace + Complete autonomy (Week 5-6)
- Template creation interface
- Version control system
- Template inheritance
- Add support for replicate api - image/video
- Add support pexels
- Style transfer
- Marketplace UI
- Trend analysis enhancements (google trends, and/or similar)
- Robust text overlays/captioning/subtitle via whisper with word level timestamps - grounding of text via the transcript
- Create any and all missing components
- Prompt engineering for the ai based editing/assembling/stiching

*Should be multiple services to maintain the modularity we aim for*
- Needs to be HIGHLY customizable from the frontend (ie prompts, temp, model, etc - whether vision is used for the model they select, need to be able to set any model string they want)
- Autonomous video editing - mainly via transcript - but vision support is good too (AI - AI agent(s) - llm tool calls or xml formatting to act as a tool for controlling the edits etc, b-roll generator, etc)
- Autonomous video creation (AI - AI agent(s) - llm tool calls or xml formatting to act as a tool for controlling the edits etc, b-roll generator, etc)
- Autonomous template creation (AI - AI agent(s) - llm tool calls or xml formatting to act as a tool for controlling the edits etc, b-roll generator, etc)

- Connecting services throughout the app

### Phase 6: Final Polishing & Launch Preparation (Week 7-9)
- **UI/UX Final Touches:**  
  - MAJOR UI/UX ENHANCEMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS
  - Apply final design tweaks for visual consistency across components  
  - Polish animations, micro-interactions, and transitions  
  - Add additional apis that make sense for our application
- **Comprehensive Testing:**  
  - Execute full end-to-end testing across all supported devices and browsers  
  - Validate all integrations (AI services, rendering, collaboration) under production-like conditions
- **Marketing & Support Readiness:**  
  - Finalize user documentation, FAQs, and video tutorials  
  - Coordinate with marketing for launch materials and press kits  
  - Establish post-launch support and feedback channels
