# Project Brief: AI-Driven Video Generation Platform

This project aims to build an AI-Driven Video Generation Platform with a strong emphasis on modularity. The platform will provide an end-to-end solution that includes:
- AI Services Integration (text, image, voice synthesis, style transfer, trend analysis, etc.)
- Autonomous video editing and creation
- A template marketplace and version control system
- A robust rendering pipeline utilizing FFmpeg and WASM

Core requirements include a modular structure, clear API endpoints, and the ability to customize AI parameters from the frontend. The architecture is built on Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma. DaisyUI is used for rapid and scalable development.

The project's overall mission is to be a next-generation video automation platform, providing users with powerful AI tools to create engaging video content.
