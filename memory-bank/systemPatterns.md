# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
1. **Component Patterns**
   - Hierarchical component structure (/components)
   - Reusable UI components (DaisyUI based)
   - Smart/dumb component separation
   - Higher-order components for shared functionality

2. **State Management**
   - Zustand stores for global state
   - Separate stores for editor, templates, and collaboration
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - WebSocket integration for real-time features

### Backend Architecture
1. **API Design**
   - RESTful endpoints under /app/api
   - Route handlers for specific functionalities
   - Middleware for authentication and validation
   - Error handling patterns

2. **Service Layer**
   - Dedicated services for AI, media, and templates
   - Clear service boundaries and interfaces
   - Dependency injection patterns
   - Error propagation strategy

### Database Patterns
1. **Prisma Schema Design**
   - Clear model relationships and cascades
   - Strategic use of indexes
   - JSON storage for flexible data
   - Version control implementation

2. **Data Access**
   - Repository pattern via Prisma Client
   - Transaction management
   - Optimized query patterns
   - Relationship handling

## Integration Patterns
1. **AI Services**
   - Modular prompt engineering system
   - Service adapters for different AI providers
   - Asynchronous processing queue
   - Error recovery strategies

2. **Media Processing**
   - FFmpeg pipeline architecture
   - WebSocket progress reporting
   - Asset management system
   - Caching strategies

3. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - WebSocket communication
   - State synchronization
   - Conflict resolution
   - User presence tracking

## Design Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle in components and services
- Interface segregation in API design
- Dependency inversion in service architecture
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) through shared utilities
- SOLID principles in overall architecture
